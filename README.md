# socket.io_auth0_Seed-Proposal
Proposal for new auth0 socket.io seed project

This project started exactly where the socket.io tutorial for creating a chat application ends.
So this basically just adds Auth0 capabilities to the chat, thus making it secure.
My thinking is that a newbie to both Socket.io as well as to Auth0 can comprenhend more easily 
what was added to or modified on it to use Auth0 as the authentication and authorization provider.
